You earn points by answering correctly. At the end of the experiment, you will receive a monetary reward depending on how many points you earn. For each correct answer, you receive either 0, 2, or 8 points, depending on the cue at the start of the trial.

The cue-arrow indicates for which answer (left or right) you earn 8 points, if you get it correct. For example, if the cue-arrow points to the left, and you correctly answer left, you earn 8 points. However, if the cue-arrow points to the left, and the correct answer is right, you earn 2 points if you answer right - you never earn points for wrong answers!

If the cue points in both directions, you will not receive points.
