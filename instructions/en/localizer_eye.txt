In the next trials, you will see an arrow. Remember where it points to (left or right). As soon as the arrow disappears, make an EYE MOVEMENT towards the +-sign that was indicated by the arrow. When the fixation cross appears again, move your eyes to the center fixation cross.

Respond as fast as possible, without making mistakes.
